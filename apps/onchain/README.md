## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

# Add WebAssembly target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

## Contract Lifecycle Notes

- `crowdfund_vault` now stores an explicit schema version during initialization and exposes `migrate` for legacy instances upgraded from older WASM without a version marker.
- New projects receive a rolling milestone expiry deadline. If the deadline passes without progress, the project moves into an expired state and contributors can reclaim funds through a timed clawback window.
- Bulk contributor refunds remain available for canceled or expired projects so funds do not stay trapped after stalled project lifecycles.
